## 🔍 Overview

Exercise Form Evaluator is an intelligent fitness assistant that uses computer vision to analyze and provide feedback on exercise techniques. Whether you're doing squats, push-ups, or bicep curls, this application helps ensure you're performing exercises correctly to maximize effectiveness and prevent injuries.

The system works with:
- Real-time camera input from your webcam
- Uploaded video files for analysis
- Various common strength and conditioning exercises

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time Exercise Classification**: Automatically identifies which exercise you're performing
- **Form Analysis**: Tracks key body points and evaluates form against correct technique models
- **Personalized Feedback**: Provides specific suggestions to correct form issues
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors improvement over time
- **Exercise Library**: Supports multiple common exercises with expansion capability
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple controls for video upload or camera activation

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Webcam (for real-time analysis)
- GPU recommended for faster processing

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mouradboutrid/computer-vision-fitness-exercise.git
   cd exercise-form-evaluator
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download required models:
   ```bash
   python setup.py download_models
   ```

## 💻 Usage

### Running with Live Camera

```bash
python -m app.main --source camera
```

### Analyzing a Video File

```bash
python -m app.main --source video --input path/to/your/video.mp4
```

### Web Interface

1. Start the web server:
   ```bash
   python -m app.main --interface web
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

## 🏋️‍♂️ Supported Exercises

The current version supports the following exercises:
- Squats
- Push-ups
Additional exercises will be added in future updates.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Pose Detection**: Using MediaPipe or OpenPose to detect human body keypoints
2. **Exercise Classification**: ML model identifies which exercise is being performed
3. **Form Analysis**: Compares joint angles and positions with correct form references
4. **Feedback Generation**: Creates specific, actionable feedback based on detected issues
5. **Visualization**: Displays feedback and form correction guides on the input video

### Key Technologies

- **OpenCV**: Video processing and visualization
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: Deep learning framework for pose estimation and classification
- **MediaPipe**: Human pose tracking
- **Flask/FastAPI**: Web interface backend (if using web interface)
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations for angle calculations
